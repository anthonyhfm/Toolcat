| Linux  | Yes | Yes | Install libimobiledevice | No             |
| MacOS  | Yes | Yes | Install libimobiledevice | Yes            |

## How do I connect my device?

1. Enable developer mode on your phone
2. Connect your device via USB
3. Trust your computer if a dialog pops up

Done! You should be ready to go :)

## Build it yourself

This project is built with [Hydraulic Conveyor](https://www.hydraulic.dev/). 

Install the Conveyor [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hydraulic/conveyor):

```shell
npm install -g @hydraulic/conveyor
```

After the installation is done, you can open the root directory of this project and run:
```shell
./gradlew build

conveyor make site
```

This should build executables for all platforms in the `/output` directory.
